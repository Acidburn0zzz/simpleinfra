# Travis CI configuration snippets

This directory contains some shared configuration snippets used on CIs managed
by the Rust Infrastructure team. Check out each script for a description of it
(usually present in comments on the first lines).

There are no stability guarantees for these snippets, since they're supposed to
only be used in infra managed by us.
